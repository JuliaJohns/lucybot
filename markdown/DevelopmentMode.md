## Development Mode
> The LucyBot server should **not** be used in production

Rebuilding your site each time you make a change can slow down
the development cycle, so LucyBot provides a development server
that auto-reloads your changes.

```bash
lucybot serve --port 3000

# Server is now listening on port 3000
# Any file changes will be automatically reloaded
```

Note that for changes to HTML templates (navbar, footer, and loading screen)
you'll need to restart the server.
